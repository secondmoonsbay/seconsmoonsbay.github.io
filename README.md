## Welcome to the Planet's Core

First of all, thank you for considering helping me build my webpage. I have some very basic and rudimental knowledge of programming, but everything I want to do exceeds by far my skills.

As you will be able to read from the Template Info, I downloaded this code from a free webpage that allows you to alter and use it to build your own site.

I thought it looked very nice and was responsive and very well laid out for me to have a strong start.

Below I will leave a list of the things I would like to add for now. I will explain every implementation as detailed as possible, in order to make it the easiest I can.

I am an independent writer so far, so the only thing I can offer yu in exchange is the following:

    1- I will create you a character of your choosing for my stories. You just have to email me Name, Special Trait (over empathic, aggressive, cooks really well,...), Special Physical Feature (big nose, small mouth, dreamy surfer boy hair), How the character dies: choose your characters death, seriously, or I will choose for you in case I kill her/him/it. Maybe they do not die, although we all do at some point, but who knows.
    
    2- Your name and link to your programmers portfolio or webpage on the Wall of Heroes (which I also need help creating)

If you have any question, I am just one email away: fpl_secondmoonsbay@tutamail.com


Thank you very much again!



## Implementations Request List

1. FIX VULNERABILITY ISSUES

2. SPANISH AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE OPTIONS:
    - Add a Spanish version of the web.
    - The text I will add myself, but I would need to add the button and the option to change it.
    - Buttons should be called English and Espa√±ol respectively.
    - I want the buttons to be right under the Welcome to nova main title.
    - The buttons should have the same format as the others on the page.
    - Users should be able to toggle between both languages very easily, in order to get the webpage in the desired one. 
    
3. BEGINNING CHAPTERS

    - Add the first 5 chapter of book online
    - Create page that derives from parent, called portal-to-nova
    - Create button under Book 1 image
    - Button text: Start Crossing
*ADDITIONAL: If a quick and simple animation of a portal generated on screen while loading the page could be made, that would be awesoome!

4. PROJECTS IMAGE BOX FIXING
    - As you can see, the box from the Send your character to Nova is bigger than the image.
    - I want that fixed so the box and the image stay together as it does on the top.
    - Basically I want the bottom aligned and not surpassing as you can see that happens.

5. FEATURED PROJECT 2
    - There is the section of featured projet where my first book stands right now
    - I would like the same structure for when I have to post the second book of the series, but this time the image on the         right, and the text on the left.

6. Wall of Heroes

    - Create an addition page linked at the top menu
    - This page must be caller Novan Heroes
    - I am still thinking aout the overall design, so suggestions are more than welcome
    - However, the overall colours and look must be similar to the ones on the whole page
